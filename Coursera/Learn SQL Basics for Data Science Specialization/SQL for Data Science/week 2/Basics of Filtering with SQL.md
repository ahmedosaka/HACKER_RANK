Which of the following did I call “huge benefits” of filtering directly with SQL instead of relying on the client application to do it?


It will often reduce the number of records we're retrieving.

Correct
Instead of just going and grabbing a whole table and pulling every column and row from it, we can get really specific about what data we want to obtain from that table


It increases the strain on the client-side of the application, but it’s worth it because of greater specificity in the results.


It ensures you're getting the data that you want and need.

Correct
That’s why you want to try to push as many filters down as possible because databases are optimized to do that.


It reduces the amount of data you’re analyzing and that speeds up the query performance.

Correct
This, in turn, speeds up overall processing.
