Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
    select *
    from table;

vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table =10000
ix. review table 10000
x. tip table =10000
xi. user table =10000



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
select count(distict primary key)
from table;

select count(distinct id) as total
from Business;
i. Business =10000

select count(distinct business_id) as total
from Hours;
ii. Hours =1562

select count(distinct business_id) as total
from Category;

from Review;
v. Review =9581

select count(distinct business_id) as total
from Checkin;
vi. Checkin =493

select count(distinct business_id) as total
from Photo;
vii. Photo =6493

select count(distinct id) as total
from Photo;
vii. Photo =10000

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
    My answer is NO
    and here is my explaination:
    posing more reviews help help growing more fans by time, but it's not necessary that it will be working
    always with the same condition.
    If you check Gerals, he has less fans than Harald, however Gerald has more reviews than Harald.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.



i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes     Y

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

+-----------------------------+------+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| name                        | city | category                    | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code |
+-----------------------------+------+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| Ghost Armor SS Springs      | Mesa | Mobile Phone Accessories    |   2.0 | Saturday|10:00-21:00 |            3 | 85206       |
| Cash Time Loan Center       | Mesa | Check Cashing/Pay-day Loans |   3.0 | Saturday|9:00-18:00  |            4 | 85210       |
| Eklectic Pie - Mesa         | Mesa | Gluten-Free                 |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-22:00 |          129 | 85204       |
| Health For Life: North Mesa | Mesa | Cannabis Clinics            |   4.5 | Saturday|9:00-20:00  |           16 | 85215       |
| Green Corner Restaurant     | Mesa | Restaurants                 |   5.0 | Saturday|10:30-22:00 |          267 | 85210       |
+-----------------------------+------+-----------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+

As per the above results, i don't see any kind of collerations between the location or the working hours with the raiting since the review count is not that high and not enough data to judge.
 1-3 stars doesn't have much data to judge if it's bad or good. Seems that it's a new store and it should get better by time.

 
SQL code used for analysis:
select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa'
 group by business.stars;

 
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| name                        | is_open | category                 | stars | hours                | review_count | postal_code |
+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| Ghost Armor SS Springs      |       0 | Mobile Phone Accessories |   2.0 | Saturday|10:00-21:00 |            3 | 85206       |
| Health For Life: North Mesa |       1 | Cannabis Clinics         |   4.5 | Saturday|9:00-20:00  |           16 | 85215       |
+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+-------------+

i. Difference 1:
      the one that is open has more reviews

ii. Difference 2:
     the working hours of the open one is earlier and it's located in the north.


SQL code used for analysis:

select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, business.postal_code,
business.is_open
from business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Mesa'
 group by business.is_open;

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
      My goal aim to find the colleration between the user number of reviews and what cities they live or rate mostly in and since when they have been rating stores..

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
            I will need the user name and user review_count, yelping_since and on the other side, i will be in need for the business stars, postal_code, check if still, Is_open
            

iii. Output of your finished dataset:


+---------+--------------+---------------------+-----------+-------+-------------+---------+
| name    | review_count | yelping_since       | city      | stars | postal_code | is_open |
+---------+--------------+---------------------+-----------+-------+-------------+---------+

| Marlene |           27 | 2011-02-18 00:00:00 | Las Vegas |   3.5 | 89109       |       1 |
| W       |          198 | 2008-12-21 00:00:00 | Las Vegas |   3.5 | 89141       |       1 |
| Just    |           62 | 2008-01-04 00:00:00 | Las Vegas |   2.0 | 89109       |       1 |
+---------+--------------+---------------------+-----------+-------+-------------+---------+

iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:


select
user.name, user.review_count, user.yelping_since, business.city, business.stars, business.postal_code, business.is_open
from (user inner join review on user.id = review.user_id) inner join business on review.business_id = business.id;
