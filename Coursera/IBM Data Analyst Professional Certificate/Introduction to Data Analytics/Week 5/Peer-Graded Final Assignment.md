    List at least 5 (five) data points that are required for the analysis and detection of a credit card fraud. (3 marks)
    
    1- IP Address. any sudden change with the ip address may lead to credit card fraud.
    
    2-USER ID. I need it to check which user have done that transaction.
    
    3- Account number. Since not all accounts has the same transaction volume history.
    
    4- transaction date.
    
    5- transaction time.
    
    6- Shipping address. For any sudden change to the shipping address, there might be a fraud case. (depends on the transaction amount)
    
    7 - Units Purchased. If there is too much units purchased for a user who buy once a month, yes this might be a fraud case.
    
    8- transaction value.

    Refer to the data table below and identify 2 (two) anomalies or unexpected behaviors, that would lead you to believe the transaction may be suspect. (2 marks)
    
    
    1- the 6th transaction of Johnp seems to be a fraud since the address is different and the date is very close to the previous one and also the units purchased count is 20 which would make suspect that this is a fraud transaction.
    
    2-the last transaction in that table has ellend purchase with over 4000 USD which is over the average so far and will get shipped to different P.O box, which would make me suspect that it's 100% fraud case, unless she is buying something to her brother.

    Identify the type of analysis that you are performing when you are analyzing historical credit card data to understand what a fraudulent transaction looks like. 
    
    Hint: The four types of Analytics include: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive. (1 mark)
    
    Mine is Diagnostic and Prescriptive since I don't have all the data that I need to say It's 100% correct like if Ellend was really in need for the laptop or not.
    
    fraudulent transactions looks like someone who order large amount of units of the same item in different sizes in one transaction and also send it to different address and or login from different IP address or even hide his IP address.
